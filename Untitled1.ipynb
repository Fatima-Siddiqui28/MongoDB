        " Q.1     What are the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases ?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans.    SQL databases are relational, meaning they store data in structured tables with rows and columns. Each table has a defined schema, and relationships between tables are established using keys.\n",
        "NoSQL databases are non-relational. They store data in various formats such as documents (like JSON), key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graphs. This allows for more flexibility in how data is organized.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL databases require a fixed schema. You must define the structure of your data before inserting it, and changes to the schema can be complex.\n",
        "NoSQL databases offer a dynamic schema, allowing you to store data without a predefined structure. This is ideal for applications that evolve quickly or handle diverse data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL databases typically scale vertically, meaning you increase the capacity of a single server (e.g., more CPU, RAM).\n",
        "NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, which means you can add more servers to handle increased load. This makes them well-suited for big data and high-traffic applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL databases use Structured Query Language (SQL), a powerful and standardized language for querying and manipulating data.\n",
        "NoSQL databases use custom query languages depending on the type. For example, MongoDB uses a JSON-like syntax, while Cassandra uses CQL (Cassandra Query Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL databases are known for ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), which ensures reliable transactions and data integrity.\n",
        "NoSQL databases often prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency (following the CAP theorem). Many offer eventual consistency, though some support ACID transactions in limited ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL is ideal for applications that require complex queries, structured data, and strong consistency—like financial systems or enterprise software.\n",
        "NoSQL is better suited for applications that handle large volumes of unstructured data, need rapid development, or require high scalability—like social media platforms, real-time analytics, or IoT systems.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q.4  How does MongoDB ensure high availability using replication ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.  MongoDB ensures high availability through replica sets—groups of servers with one primary and multiple secondaries.\n",
        "- The primary handles writes; secondaries replicate data.\n",
        "- If the primary fails, a secondary is automatically elected as the new primary.\n",
        "- This provides fault tolerance, data redundancy, and minimal downtime.\n",

        "- Core feature from the start; deeply integrated into relational databases.\n",
        "- Used extensively for multi-row and multi-table operations.\n",
        "- Strong consistency and isolation are default behaviors.\n",
        "- Ideal for normalized data models that require frequent joins and updates across tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Differences :\n",
        "- MongoDB favors denormalized data, reducing the need for transactions.\n",
        "- SQL relies on normalized schemas, making transactions essential.\n",
        "- MongoDB transactions are newer and more flexible, but may incur higher performance costs in distributed setups.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans.   Here’s a concise comparison between capped collections and regular collections in MongoDB:\n",
        "\n",
        "Capped Collections :\n",
        "- Have a fixed size and maximum document count.\n",
        "- Automatically overwrite oldest documents when full.\n",
        "- Maintain insertion order, ideal for logs or queues.\n",
        "- Support tailable cursors for real-time data streaming.\n",
        "- Cannot be sharded or used in transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular Collections :\n",
        "- Have no size limit—documents accumulate indefinitely.\n",
        "- Do not overwrite old data.\n",
        "- Support flexible schema, indexing, and sharding.\n",
        "- Suitable for general-purpose data storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Capped collections are best for use cases like logging, caching, or message queues, while regular collections are used for most standard applications like user data, product catalogs, or content storage.\n",

        "Q.21  What is the purpose of the $match stage in MongoDB’s aggregation pipeline ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.  The $match stage in MongoDB’s aggregation pipeline is used to filter documents based on specified conditions, similar to a find() query. Its main purpose is to narrow down the dataset early in the pipeline so that only relevant documents are passed to subsequent stages.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Why It’s Useful :\n",
        "- Improves performance by reducing the number of documents processed.\n",
        "- Supports complex queries using operators like $gt, $lt, $in, and $regex.\n",
        "- Works best when placed early in the pipeline to take advantage of indexes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, $match helps streamline data processing by selecting only the documents that meet your criteria.\n",

        "Q.22  How can you secure access to a MongoDB database ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.  To secure access to a MongoDB database, it's essential to implement a combination of authentication, authorization, encryption, and network-level protections. Here’s a breakdown of the most effective strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "Core Security Measures :\n",
        "1. Enable Authentication\n",
        "- Prevents unauthorized access by requiring users to log in.\n",
        "- Use mechanisms like SCRAM, x.509 certificates, or LDAP.\n",
        "- Create database users with strong passwords.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) :\n",
        "- Assign roles to users based on the principle of least privilege.\n",
        "- Examples: read, readWrite, dbAdmin, clusterAdmin.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Use TLS/SSL for Data in Transit :\n",
        "- Encrypts communication between clients and the server.\n",
        "- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Encrypt Data at Rest :\n",
        "- Protects stored data using file system or MongoDB-native encryption.\n",
        "- MongoDB Enterprise supports Queryable Encryption and Client-Side Field Level Encryption.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Restrict Network Access :\n",
        "- Bind MongoDB to specific IP addresses.\n",
        "- Use firewalls and configure IP whitelists (especially in MongoDB Atlas).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Change Default Port :\n",
        "- MongoDB uses port 27017 by default, which is commonly targeted.\n",
        "- Modify it in the mongod.conf file to reduce exposure.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Enable Auditing and Monitoring :\n",
        "- Track database activities to detect suspicious behavior.\n",
        "- MongoDB Enterprise includes auditing features.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Keep MongoDB Updated :\n",
        "- Regular updates patch known vulnerabilities.\n",
        "- Always use the latest stable version.\n",
        "\n",
        "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

        "Q.24   What is MongoDB’s WiredTiger storage engine, and why is it important?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.   MongoDB’s WiredTiger storage engine is the default engine that powers fast, reliable, and efficient data handling. It supports document-level concurrency, meaning multiple writes can happen at once without locking the whole database. It also offers data compression to save disk space, checkpointing for crash recovery, and smart cache management for performance.\n",
        "In short, WiredTiger is important because it makes MongoDB faster, more scalable, and better suited for modern, high-volume applications.\n",
